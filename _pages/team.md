### Nancy Chen - *Principal Investigator*

I am an evolutionary biologist interested in the genomic basis of contemporary evolution in natural populations. My research integrates genomics and long-term demographic studies with pedigree data to characterize the evolutionary processes shaping patterns of variation across the genome through space and time. I earned my Ph.D. with Andy Clark and John Fitzpatrick at Cornell University and then did a postdoc with Graham Coop at UC Davis before joining the faculty at the University of Rochester in 2018.

### Felix Beaudry - *Postdoctoral Scholar*

Felix is interested in the evolution of sex, sex chromosomes and sexual conflict. Combining quantitative and population genetics, Felix investigates how non-additive genetic effects like linkage and dominance impact the evolution of sex. Felix is also interested in developing a teaching plan that explores the genetics of sex and clearly distinguishes sex from gender. Felix did his PhD on plant sex chromosomes at the University of Toronto. For more, see [Felix’s website](https://felixbeaudryresearch.com/).

### Elsie Shogren - *Postdoctoral Scholar (co-advised by Al Uy)*

Elsie wants to understand how behavior, ecology, and the environment interact to shape the evolutionary trajectories of birds. Testing predictions at behavioral, physiological, and genomic levels, she is working to determine what drives repeated evolution of melanism in island populations of Monarcha flycatchers. Elsie completed her Ph.D. at Kansas State University with Dr. Alice Boyle, studying how the abiotic environment influences the scope of sexual selection in Neotropical Manakins (Pipridae). For more, see [Elsie’s website](https://ehshogren.wordpress.com/).

### Lindsey Perrin - *Graduate Student*

Lindsey Perrin studied ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Rochester as an undergraduate student. She loves biology and is interested in studying genomics and evolutionary genetics while pursuing a career in research.

### Jeremy Summers - *Graduate Student*

Jeremy is an E2G2 student interested in how population demography and habitat conditions affect short-term evolution and population growth or decline. He studied environmental engineering at Carnegie Melon University as an undergrad. He loves the diversity of life that has existed in the past and still exists today, and hopes to contribute to conserving that diversity through his research.

### Michaela Burrell - *Undergraduate Researcher*

Michaela is a Take 5 Scholar, majoring in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology with a minor in Computational Biology. She is interested in conservation biology, specifically conservation issues involving bird species. Michaela is a captain of Rochester’s Varsity Track and Field Team. Each migration season, she is a volunteer at the Braddock Bay Bird Observatory.

### Kristin Hardy - *Undergraduate Researcher*

Kristin is an undergraduate majoring in molecular genetics. She is interested in genetic mutations and population genetics and is pursuing a career in genetic counseling. Outside of the Chen Lab, she works in the URMC emergency department and enrolls patients in emergency medicine research studies and she is also a member of the women’s track and field team.

### Matthew Le - *Undergraduate Researcher*

Matt is from Lake Placid, New York currently majoring in Computational Biology and minoring in Chinese. In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, piano and video games. I am not exactly sure what it is that I am interested in yet but I enjoy learning and am very excited to work in the lab this semester. So I guess another way to put it is that, as of right now, I am interested in everything!

### Gladiana Spitz - *Undergraduate Researcher*

Gladiana is a junior majoring in Computational Biology. She is interested in using computational methods to learn more about species' interacting phenotypes and genotypes. Outside of the classroom, she's passionate about human rights, conservation, and art. She wants to keep learning about everything for her career and hopefully be a positive influence on what she studies.

### Ceylin Zeybek - *Visiting Undergraduate Researcher*

I am a senior majoring in Molecular Biology and Genetics at Bilkent University, Turkey. I'm interested in evolution and its impact on everything ranging from populations to individual microorganisms. I am highly motivated to learn different evolutionary biology related phenomena that I could not study under my major. Outside of my career, I enjoy winter sports and rock climbing. As a summer visitor of Chen lab, I want to understand how the environmental conditions and inbreeding shape the genomic variation of the endangered Florida Scrub-Jay population. I am very happy as being the part of this lab!
