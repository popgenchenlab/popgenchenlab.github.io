### Nancy Chen - *Principal Investigator*

Nancy is an evolutionary biologist interested in the genomic basis of contemporary evolution in natural populations. Her research integrates genomics and long-term demographic studies with pedigree data to characterize the evolutionary processes shaping patterns of variation across the genome through space and time. Nancy earned her Ph.D. with Andy Clark and John Fitzpatrick at Cornell University and then did a postdoc with Graham Coop at UC Davis before moving to Rochester in 2018. She is committed to promoting justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion in STEM. In her free time, Nancy enjoys running, hiking, cooking, and playing board games.

### Felix Beaudry - *Postdoctoral Scholar*

Felix is interested in the evolution of sex, sex chromosomes and sexual conflict. Combining quantitative and population genetics, Felix investigates how non-additive genetic effects like linkage and dominance impact the evolution of sex. Felix is also interested in developing a teaching plan that explores the genetics of sex and clearly distinguishes sex from gender. Felix did his PhD on plant sex chromosomes at the University of Toronto. For more, see [Felix’s website](https://felixbeaudryresearch.com/).

### Elsie Shogren - *Postdoctoral Scholar (co-advised by Al Uy)*

Elsie wants to understand how behavior, ecology, and the environment interact to shape the evolutionary trajectories of birds. She is studying a system of sympatric Myzomela honeyeaters to learn how hybridization and recently evolved sex chromosomes influence genetic introgression and speciation. Elsie completed her Ph.D. at Kansas State University with Dr. Alice Boyle, studying how the abiotic environment influences the scope of sexual selection in Neotropical Manakins (Pipridae). For more, see [Elsie’s website](https://ehshogren.wordpress.com/).

### Faye Romero - *Graduate Student*

Faye is an incoming PhD student interested in using population genomics to study, and ultimately predict, organismal responses to human-induced environmental change. She received her undergraduate degree in Molecular Environmental Biology from UC Berkeley, where she primarily researched phenotypic evolution in Anna’s and Broad-tailed Hummingbirds. Faye also enjoys promoting science education, fantasy books, and dancing.

### Jeremy Summers - *Graduate Student*

Jeremy is a PhD student interested in the causes of population decline and the role of dispersal in demographic and evolutionary trajectories. Using population level demography, individual fitness variation, and population genetics, he is investigating how dispersal into preserved Florida Scrub-Jay habitat contributes to population growth and levels of genetic variation. Jeremy is also interested in teaching evolutionary biology with an emphasis on diversity at every level of organization and the ways humans shape and interact with our local ecosystems.

### Kristin Hardy - *Undergraduate Researcher*

Kristin is an undergraduate majoring in molecular genetics. She is interested in genetic mutations and population genetics and is pursuing a career in genetic counseling. Outside of the Chen Lab, she works in the URMC emergency department and enrolls patients in emergency medicine research studies and she is also a member of the women’s track and field team.

### Siddarth Seenivasa - *Undergraduate Researcher*

Sid hails from Dallas, TX and is currently majoring in Molecular Genetics and ASL. He is interested in methods development for analyzing genomic data and is excited to learn more about population genetics. When he’s not hunched over his desk, Sid is either writing music for his band or podcasting with his friends (Certified Loverboys on Spotify). He is always down to grab food and talk research or exchange languages!

### Bailey Jones - *Visiting Undergraduate Researcher*

Bailey is a rising senior at Swarthmore College majoring in Biology with a minor in Classical Studies. She is eager to build upon knowledge from past coursework in honing a deeper understanding and appreciation of population genomics and conservation through her work in the Chen Lab. As a summer visitor, she will be quantifying the effect of helpers in the cooperatively breeding Florida Scrub-Jay. Outside of the classroom, she enjoys playing the guitar and language learning.

### Dashi and Espurr - *Lab pets*

Dashi and Espurr are second-year cats with broad interests including displays of affection, sleeping, and occasionally learning tricks. Dashi is our resident entomologist and wants to investigate the culinary uses of insects, if his lab-mate Jeremy would let him catch any. Espurr is specializing in botany and has discovered that frequent face rubbing with plants triggers a strong purr response in herself.

### Minka - *Lab pet*

Minka is a springerdoodle who is currently growing and learning a lot. She loves chewing on sticks and wants to play with every person/dog/cat she meets.
