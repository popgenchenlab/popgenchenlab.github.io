### Nancy Chen - *Principal Investigator*

I am an evolutionary biologist interested in the genomic basis of contemporary evolution in natural populations. My research integrates genomics and long-term demographic studies with pedigree data to characterize the evolutionary processes shaping patterns of variation across the genome through space and time. I earned my Ph.D. with Andy Clark and John Fitzpatrick at Cornell University and then did a postdoc with Graham Coop at UC Davis before joining the faculty at the University of Rochester in 2018.
