### The Chen lab is a safe space.

The lack of diversity in STEM is an important issue, and one that I care deeply about and am dedicated to help address. I believe that it is our responsibility to educate ourselves about diversity issues in STEM, learn how best to combat bias, and work to promote social equality and build inclusive communities. I am always happy to talk about these and related issues, and will actively work to help make STEM more inclusive and welcoming to all.
